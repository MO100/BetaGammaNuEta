        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p class="muted">Pride • Brotherhood • Respect</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mission-content">
        <h3>Promote pride in culture, education and honor of its members</h3>
        <p>
        Our fraternity promotes the diversity of our brothers and the richness of our culture.
        We teach scholastic achievement through education. As a fraternity we honor our members by working
        hard to provide them with the best college experience and professional network possible as they
        transition from undergraduate to alumni.
        </p>

        <h3>Built unity via the idea of brotherhood in arms across the nation</h3>
        <p>
        Fraternity membership’s greatest benefit is the creation of lifelong friendships. The fraternity
        fulfills the need of students to belong to an extended family and provides the opportunity to
        enhance those personal relationships through leadership, community service and self-improvement.
        The welfare of our members is the obligation for all our brothers. Brotherhood is a lifetime
        commitment; therefore, we encourage strong undergraduate-alumni relationships for the mutual benefit
        of all members.
        </p>

        <h3>Teach respect for life, community and well-being of others</h3>
        <p>
        Our fraternity teaches the value of respecting all life and how precious life is. We encourage all our
        members to participate with campus events which give a sense of belonging and to teach the community
        the positive contributions of Greek organizations. The well-being of others (family, friends, and
        community) is important to our members.
        </p>

        <h3>Foster growth in spiritual, mental and social well-being of its members</h3>
        <p>
        The well-being of our members is important to us as a fraternity. It is especially important to have
        the opportunity to grow spiritually and mentally. As one grows to a more mature individual we have
        the opportunities to acquire more knowledge; to grow as a person is an endeavor that this fraternity
        promotes. The well-being of our members means we reject any device that is in conflict with a
        healthy, spiritual, mental and emotional state of a person.
        </p>

        <h3>Give back and serve the public interest</h3>
        <p>
        Community service is important to us and our members. Service to our local neighborhood is a must,
        because it gives us a sense of belonging and commitment that we are part of the community. We serve
        the public interest by being responsible fraternity members. We must abide by all local, state, and
        federal laws. As fraternity men we are taught that we must be responsible for our actions and must
        have higher standards than the average college student.
        </p>

        <h3>Support the purpose and goals of Colleges and Universities</h3>
        <p>
        Our fraternity is committed to fostering a close partnership with all colleges and universities
        where our chapters exist. We promote academic achievement and assist each member to achieve their
        potential. Providing programs to help our members pursue their degree of higher learning, our
        fraternity encourages all its chapters to have 100% graduation rate. We promote higher learning in
        traditional colleges and universities. It encourages all members to further their academic endeavors
        by means of graduate and/or doctorate programs.

        <p>
        In 1997, Beta Gamma Nu was founded on the campus of the University of Southern California.
        The young men that founded the fraternity saw a need that was not being fulfilled and created
        a fraternal organization for students not being represented by the Greek system. Beta Gamma Nu,
        with its values of Pride in Culture, Brotherhood in Arms, and Respect for Life, seeks out men
        with common values to spread the message that a full college experience is in reach of all men.
        </p>

        <p>
        Since its introduction to the Greek system, Beta Gamma Nu has expanded to other universities and
        has shared our values with men of like vision and inclusion of all into our brotherhood. The rich
        experience our fraternity brings to these students is one that will stay with them as they move
        into their professional careers.
        </p>

        <p>
        As our fraternity grows in chapters and in members, it will have a positive influence on those
        students that it touches. Beta Gamma Nu is still a young fraternity among many great ones and the
        story of our fraternity is still being written. We are a diverse group of individuals, motivated
        to succeed in our professional careers and to teach the value of culture, education, brotherhood,
        respect for life, community, and family among our members.
        </p>

        <p>
        One such chapter is right here in Fresno. The <strong>Fresno State Eta Chapter</strong>
        was established on <strong>May 24th 2013</strong>. Built on the pillars of
        <strong>Pride, Brotherhood, and Respect</strong>, our chapter began as a small group
        committed to uplifting one another academically, professionally, and personally.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Since then, Eta Chapter has grown into a tight-knit network of scholars and leaders who serve
        the Fresno State campus and the greater Fresno community through mentorship, volunteer
        outreach, and culturally grounded events. Today, our members balance academics with
        service and leadership—hosting study nights, partnering with campus orgs and local
        nonprofits, and cultivating an alumni pipeline that supports internships and career
        exploration for active brothers.

            So, your son, grandson, nephew, or the young man of the house has taken an interest in joining
            the collegiate Greek community. Greek life can be an integral part of the college experience,
            and we want families to feel confident and excited about that choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our fraternity was built on family and community values. We emphasize a safe, supportive
            environment for growth—academically, personally, and professionally. We are a <strong>non-hazing</strong>
            fraternity, prohibit alcohol at fraternity events, and prioritize academic achievement
            (our “#1 goal is to graduate”). Members receive mentorship, resources, and accountability to help
            them succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
            We aim to be a support system for your student as they transition into independence. Our mission is
            to create a culture that promotes well‑being, follows university policies, and keeps families in the loop
            through events, updates, and volunteer opportunities.
